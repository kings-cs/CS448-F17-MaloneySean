	Hill climbing's success rate with no sideways steps is much higher than that reported by the text but
the amount of steps before success or failure line up very well. With 100 sideways steps the success rate is higher than 
that reported by the text and the amount of steps taking for each success is much lower than that reported by the text.

	The amount of generations needed is improved both by increasing
the number of generations and the mutation rate. From these results,
it appears that the higher mutation rate has a more drastic effect.

	The extra work of the genetic algorithms is still much better
than that of a Bogo search as it still runs through fewer nodes.
