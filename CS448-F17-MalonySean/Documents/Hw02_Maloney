	Hill Climbing is not functioning according to the text book.
The results for no Sideways steps are far too low. While
the average success steps may be correct for the 100 sideways
steps run, the success rate is higher than the book says it should be.

	The amount of generations needed is improved both by increasing
the number of generations and the mutation rate. From these results,
it appears that the higher mutation rate has a more drastic effect.

	The extra work of the genetic algorithms is still much better
than that of a Bogo search as it still runs through fewer nodes.
